# ICS Security Sentinel - Project Overview

## About This Project

ICS Security Sentinel is a cybersecurity framework I developed for monitoring Industrial Control Systems (ICS), SCADA networks, and Operational Technology (OT) environments. The project focuses on real-time threat detection, behavioral analysis, and automated incident response for industrial environments.

## Technical Architecture

The framework is built with a modular Python architecture that includes:

- **Protocol Analysis Engine**: Native support for Modbus, DNP3, and OPC UA protocols
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Complete mapping to MITRE ATT&CK for ICS tactics and techniques  
- **Sigma Rules Engine**: Custom detection rules specifically designed for industrial environments
- **Machine Learning Detection**: Behavioral analysis using isolation forest algorithms
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous network traffic analysis and threat detection
- **Docker Deployment**: Complete containerized stack for production deployment

## Key Features

### Security Monitoring
- Real-time packet capture and analysis
- Protocol-specific threat detection
- Network baseline establishment and deviation detection
- Cross-zone communication monitoring

### Threat Detection
- 25+ custom Sigma rules for ICS environments
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- Automated threat categorization and prioritization

### Enterprise Integration
- SIEM forwarding capabilities
- REST API for external integrations
- Webhook support for alerting
- Comprehensive reporting and dashboards

### Compliance Support
- IEC 62443 security standard alignment
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework mapping
- NIS 2 Directive compliance reporting
- Audit logging and documentation


## Use Cases

This framework addresses real-world challenges in industrial cybersecurity:

- **Manufacturing Plants**: Monitor PLC communications and detect unauthorized changes
- **Power Grids**: Analyze SCADA protocols and identify grid manipulation attempts
- **Water Treatment**: Detect anomalous control system behavior
- **Oil & Gas**: Monitor pipeline control systems for security threats
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Comprehensive OT security monitoring
